_Compute products under Absolute Relativity._

This is a Rust re-implementation of the Python framework [arpy](https://github.com/sminez/arpy).
It is intended to provide better confidence in the correctness of the algorithms
and also provide a speed up in computation for when we need to iterate on large
calculations.
