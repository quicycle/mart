"""
By inspection we can show that for alphas with a single index,
or the Quadrivector, the net sign following pops is unchanged.
For Bivectors and Trivectors the sign is reversed:

a -> a       (no pops: no sign change)
ab -> ba     (1 pop:   sign change)
abc -> cba   (3 pops:  sign change)
  -acb
   cab
  -cba
abcd -> dcba (6 pops: no sign change)
  -abdc
   adbc
  -dabc
   dacb
  -dcab
   dcba

Even though we only need to carry this operation out for objects of
grade 0 -> 4, we can show that the number of pops required for reversing
an Alpha of grade n is the (n-1)th triangular number.
